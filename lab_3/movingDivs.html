	XHTML is a variant of HTML that uses the syntax of XML, the
	Extensible Markup Language. XHTML has all the same elements (for
	paragraphs, etc.) as the HTML variant, but the syntax is
	slightly different. Because XHTML is an XML application, you can
	use other XML tools with it (such as XSLT, a language for
	transforming XML content).

	CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web
	pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to
	adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as
	large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of
	HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The
	separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites,
	share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different
	environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure
	(or: content) from presentation.
